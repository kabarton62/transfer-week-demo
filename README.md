Provides scripts to:
  1. **docker-install.sh**: Install Docker engine on Ubuntu
  2. **add-user.sh**:       Add users on an Ubuntu server and distribute private keys (in the worst way possible)
  3. **mutillidae.sh**:     Deploy a Mutillidae Docker container
  4. **ssh.bat**:           Start a SSH shell using a Windows Batch script (so there's not a lot of time spent troubleshooting failed SSH attempts)
  5. **deluser.sh**:        Delete all those users we added and their ssh-rsa keys
  6. **revshell-gen.sh**:   Used to generate reverse shells for each student, assuming the usernames are p4401 through p4430. Obviously won't work if the username  doesn't fit this format.
